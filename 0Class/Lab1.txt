	Lab questions
	1	a	Stack pointer is reduced by 8
		b	r7=0X10001fe0
			lr=0X000001bf
		c	origional value of r7 (r7) and the return address (lr).
	2	a	The values are stored in r0=5 and r1=6
	3	Both values of R0 and R1 are used in the function and no other values are pulled from the stack (which would imply more then 2 parameters).
	4	a	0X0000019a
		b	moving result of r3 into r0
